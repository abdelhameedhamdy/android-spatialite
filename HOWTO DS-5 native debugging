In order DS-5 to work, you need to have its specially modified version of gdbserver copied on the target device together with the .so libs.
Make sure you have a rooted device. "Root access to apps and ADB" switched on in Android system settings. Below replace the NDK version r9 with your current version.
sudo cp /opt/eclipse/plugins/com.arm.ds.collateral_5.17.0.20131213_212405/arm/gdbserver/android/gdbserver-dyna-7.1 /opt/android-ndk-r9/prebuilt/android-arm/gdbserver/gdbserver
adb root
adb push -p /opt/android-ndk-r9/prebuilt/android-arm/gdbserver/gdbserver /data/data/com.buildware.geocoord/lib/
Notes:
- maybe 700 permissions for gdbserver are needed too)
- gdbserver might get deleted after running with Android Studio

Start Eclipse:
- Switch to DS-5 perspective. 
- Create or edit a debug configuration and choose "Attach to a running Android application". 
- Check "Connect as root"
- Click on "Files" tab -> Load symbols from file -> /home/sevar/workspace/android-studio/geoworld/androidspatialite/build/obj/local/armeabi-v7a/libandroid_spatialite.so
- Save the debug configuration
- It is a good idea to set some breakpoints before connecting to the debug target as it may to be possible afterwards
- Click the button "Connect to Target" in the toolbar of the upper-left part of the screen
